                        <h4>ARTICLE 6 : DURATION OF THE TRIP

                            (including transfers) and the duration of the stay on site, from the time of check-in at the
                            airport on the day of departure until the time of arrival on the day of return. Thus, the

                            modifications through an email inviting them to download the modified document. It is
                            important to arrive at the airport with the printed documents (VISAS/Health Pass if
                            required) and official travel documents. The client is therefore invited to check their
                            email.</p>

                            Any presentation after the legal check-in deadline will result in the cancellation of the

                        <p >The visa can only be granted if the client
                            has submitted all the requested documents at the time of booking and if they are eligible,

                            the event of damage, complaint, or claim of any kind, exclusively to the air transport of

                            with the provisions of the current international conventions (Warsaw Convention of 1929,
                            Montreal Convention of May 28, 1999) and/or community regulations (in particular Regulation

                        <p> FlyOmra (Dogan Voyages) cannot be held
                            responsible for schedule or itinerary changes, or airport changes caused by circumstances
                            beyond its control. In such circumstances, any potential delay incurred will not result in
                            any compensation being due from FlyOmra (Dogan Voyages).</p>
                        <p >It is the client's responsibility to comply
                            with all safety rules and instructions, especially those issued by airlines. The client must
                            also comply with the internal regulations of the hotels where they stay and must not behave
                            discourteously during their trip. In general, the client must exercise caution and prudence.
                            In the event of non-compliance by the client with the above, the hotelier, the airline,
                            and/or FlyOmra (Dogan Voyages) or any other service provider will be authorized to interrupt
                            the client's stay and/or, as the case may be, the concerned travel service (e.g., boarding
                            refusal, disembarkation...) due to their wrongful behaviour. In such a case, the client will
                            not be entitled to any refund or compensation and will bear alone all costs arising from
                            this situation.</p>

                        <h5>12.1 Identity of the Air Carrier</h5>
                        <p >For its trips and Omra, FlyOmra (Dogan
                            Voyages) entrusts the realization of its flights to regular airlines. Any change or
                            modification of the airline will be communicated to the client under the conditions of the
                            aforementioned applicable texts.</p>
                        <h5 >12.2 Transport Conditions In general
                        </h5>
                        <p>air transport is subject to the general
                            conditions of transport of each airline (accessible on the airline's website), subject to
                            these general and specific conditions which prevail on certain points (such as the
                            authorized checked baggage allowance). The client therefore undertakes to familiarize
                            themselves with said conditions of transport.</p>
                        <h5>12.3 Baggage</h5>
                        <p > The authorized baggage weight limit varies
                            on international flights, and depending on the airlines and/or types of flights. You will be
                            informed by email in the travel booklet of the allowed baggage weight. Restrictive rules
                            regarding baggage (prohibited items, size/weight of cabin baggage if applicable...) are
                            available on the websites of the respective airlines; they alone have decision-making
                            authority in this matter. In the event of loss or damage to baggage during air transport, it
                            is the client's responsibility to make a declaration at the arrival airport to the airline.
                        </p>
                        <h5>12.4 Schedule/Location of Stops and
                            Connections</h5>
                        <p > The estimated departure and return times are
                            communicated to the client, with the understanding that they are subject to change. When
                            known before the reservation or at the time of reservation, the duration and location of
                            stops and connections are communicated to the client: they are also subject to change. In
                            any case and in accordance with Article L211-10 of the Tourism Code, the client will be
                            provided in due time before the start of the trip with the necessary documents and
                            information about the scheduled departure time, and, if applicable, the check-in deadline as
                            well as the expected times of stops, connections, and arrival.</p>
                        <h5 >12.5 Modifications/Cancellation</h5>
                        <p> For certain trips, departure and/or return
                            dates and/or times are subject to change if required by the airline. The client will be
                            notified by phone or email and must provide a valid phone number and email address for this
                            purpose. It is strongly recommended that the client provide their contact details,
                            especially in the event of last-minute changes so that FlyOmra (Dogan Voyages) can inform
                            the client promptly.</p>
                        <h5>12.6 Infants</h5>
                        <p > Infants under 2 years old do not have a seat
                            on the plane. If the baby is under 2 years old at the time of departure but already 2 years
                            old on the return, the airline will charge a round-trip ticket. If the baby is over 2 years
                            old, they will be charged the adult fare.</p>
                        <h5>12.7 Pregnant Women</h5>
                        <p> Airlines may require pregnant women to
                            provide a medical certificate before boarding, which must include the expected due date of
                            their pregnancy. In any case, airlines may refuse to transport pregnant women.</p>

                        </h4>
                        <h5 >13.1 Hotel Classification</h5>
                        <p > The star rating of hotels corresponds to a
                            classification based on local standards; it is established by local tourism ministries,
                            according to sometimes very different or lower standards than French standards. Furthermore,
                            for the same category, the comfort level may vary from one hotel to another.</p>
                        <h5 >13.2 Types of Rooms</h5>
                        <p >The double room is sometimes composed of two
                            single beds and sometimes a large bed. The so-called "single" room is an individual room
                            occupied by one person. The triple room is sometimes composed of two single beds and an
                            "extra bed," and the quadruple room of two single beds and two "extra beds." FlyOmra (Dogan
                            Voyages) cannot guarantee the location of the room in the hotel.</p>
                        <h5>13.3 Meals</h5>
                        <p >All services (breakfast, lunch, dinner) that
                            are not specified in the description are not included in the reserved packages.</p>
                        <h5 >13.4 Transfer </h5>
                        <p >The type of transfer included in the price is
                            mentioned in the travel booklet. There are two types of transfers: collective and private.
                            Drivers do not speak French.</p>
                        <h5>ARTICLE 14 : APPLICABLE LAW</h5>
                        <p>Any contract concluded between FlyOmra (Dogan
                            Voyages) and the client is subject to UK law.</p>
